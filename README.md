# Hi, I'm Sara 👋

I've always believed that programming is more about communication than computing.

Writing code is just one part of the process — the real challenge is understanding people, collaborating effectively, and making sure what we build is clear, maintainable, and solves the right problem.

Maybe that’s why I approach backend development the way I do: with attention to clarity, system design, and long-term impact. With over eight years of experience, I specialize in Kotlin and Java, building scalable backend systems using clean code, testing, and modern development practices.  

Most of my experience has been in domains with complex business logic — things like ETL pipelines for booking data, invoicing systems, insurance, and government. Often building systems with meaningful domain logic, not just CRUD apps. I enjoy solving difficult problems with elegant solutions, and I care deeply about reliability, observability, and the developer experience.

🧰 **Tech:**
- Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot
- TDD, DDD, Clean Architecture
- Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes
- Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- ArgoCD, Spinnaker, Grafana, SonarQube
- Python (for data analysis/sanitization)
- Angular, React, JS, NodeJs 

🌱 **What matters to me:**
- Clean, understandable code that’s easy to maintain  
- Systems that make sense, solve the right problem, and last  
- Clear communication and thoughtful collaboration  
- Empathy — in code, in teams, and in how we understand user needs  
- Cultures that support deep focus and value technical quality  
- Ownership, autonomy, and working with people who care about their craft
